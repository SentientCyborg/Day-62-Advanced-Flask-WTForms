# Day-62-Advanced-Flask-WTForms
A simple program to render a Flask WTForm using Bootstrap

This program creates a simple Flask site that simulates the tracking of Cafes and various details about them. There is a
csv file that is used as a database to track various entries.

This code was written for the assignment on Day 62 of the Udemy course [100 Days of Code by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

My version of the solution moves all the form logic into its own module. The instructor's solution has it included in "main.py".

Currently, the only way to get to the Flask form is to specifically route to it. 

This program could be improved upon by adding links to the form and enforcing validation on the time entries. Time entries are currently StringFields.
